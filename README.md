# Duco Air python library

Allows you to be able to communicate with a Duco Air system. You must have installed the Duco e.g https://www.cvtotaal.nl/duco-communication-print-voor-ducobox-silent-focus-energy.html for this plugin to work.

# Contributions

I welcome any contributions to help improve this library, please open a issue and PR to get your change merged!

# Compatibility

This library will work with anything that uses the Duco communication and print as its way of communicating with standard TCP/IP networks. Example is DucoBox Silent connect or DucoBox Focus

# Please NOTE!

I have not tested this library on various types of installs (I only have a Duco Silent to test with). The library its self is designed to scale to what ever is seen by the controller but I do know in the wild there are types of nodes that I never have touched or programed for. Please open a issue if you are missing nodes with more information about that node.
